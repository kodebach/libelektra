## Introduction

This plugin implements the full functionality of a backend.

## Example

The example below is written with cascading keys, but the keys should be interpreted as relative to a mountpoint configuration root (e.g. `system:/elektra/mountpoints/\/hosts`).

> **Note**: The `pre*` and `post*` positions are not proper arrays.
> The plugin will use all keys that are _directly below_ e.g. `/positions/get/poststorage` no matter their names.
> Using array-like names is just a convenient way to get a predictable ordering.
